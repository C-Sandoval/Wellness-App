This app is for a project for Ubiquitous Computing class(COSC 4355) at the University of Houston. 

My app’s main purpose is to provide help to users struggling with their well-being. In short, this will be a self-therapy app. The main features of the app are daily wellness checks, a questionnaire that offers solutions to the user, guided readings over providing more information about selected topics like anxiety, depression, emotions, and the resource to locate professional help if needed. 

Wellness Check: 
The wellness check can be accessed with the green button at the top of the app with the text, “How are you feeling today?”. When the user taps on the button, they are guided to a screen more dedicated to answering the question. At default, the user is prompted with the writing option where the user can type how they are feeling as of that point of time. However, there is a slider button in which the user can slide or tap to switch on over to the drawing option and vice versa. 
 
Diagnostic Questionnaire: 
The user can access this questionnaire via the purple button at the home screen or tab bar. Once the user reaches the questionnaire screen, the user will answer the questions/assessments as true as possible given the choices of “strongly agree”, “agree”, “neutral”, “disagree”, or “strongly disagree”. As the user chooses each button, a hidden assessment score is added based on the user choices and once the user answers the last question/assessment, the user is then shown a screen with provided solutions for their problems they are going through. 
 
Readings: 
The user can access the readings screen via the tab bar button that says, “Readings”. Once the user taps the tab bar book button, the user is transferred to a new screen with different color buttons with different labels. The readings offered are: “Anxiety”, “Childhood Trauma”, “Depression”, “Emotions", “Relationships”, “Stress”. Each button has different colors to trigger a certain emotion from the user. Once a user taps a button, they are then displayed a new screen with the selected topic in which it debriefs more information about the selected topic and any possible solutions to handle the matter. 
 
Professional Help: 
The professional help screen is accessed via the tab bar button, “Professional”. Once the user taps the selected tab bar button, they are then guided to a map screen where they can find professional help from local coordinates.
